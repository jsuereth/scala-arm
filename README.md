# Scala Automatic Resource Management - TEST PULL REQUEST

This project is an attempt to provide an Automatic-Resource-Management library for the scala distribution.  It is based off of code contributed to the Scalax project.

## Using scala-arm

In SBT:

    libraryDependencies += "com.jsuereth" %% "scala-arm" % "1.2"

In Maven:

    <dependency>
       <groupId>com.jsuereth</groupId>
       <artifactId>scala-arm_${scala.version}</artifactId>
       <version>1.2</version>
    </dependency>


## Examples

Scala-arm provides many ways of managing resources and re-using code.  Here's a few examples.

### Imperative Style
    
    import resource._
    // Copy input into output.
    for(input <- managed(new java.io.FileInputStream("test.txt"));
        output <- managed(new java.io.FileOutputStream("test2.txt"))) {
      val buffer = new Array[Byte](512)
      def read(): Unit = input.read(buffer) match {
        case -1 => ()
        case  n => output.write(buffer,0,size); read()
      }
      read()
    }

### Delimited continuation style

    import resource._
    import java.io.{File, FileInputStream => Fin, FileOutputStream => Fout}
    def copyFile(from: File, to: File): Unit =
      withResources {
        val f = managed(new Fin(from)).reflect[Unit]
        val t = managed(new Fout(to)).reflect[Unit]
        val buffer = new Array[Byte](512)
        def read(): Unit = f.read(buffer) match {
          case -1 => ()
          case  n => t.write(buffer,0,n); read()
        }
        read()
    }
